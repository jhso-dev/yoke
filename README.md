An AI agent with memory will repeat whatever it heard. An AI agent on yoke
speaks only knowledge that carries a source, survived review, and is still
current — and it cites its sources. Memory layers automate *what your AI
remembers*; yoke governs *what your AI is allowed to believe*.

## Why you can trust it

Trust isn't a promise here — it's five mechanisms, each enforced in code:

1. **Nothing enters without a source.** Every write passes through a single
   commit gate that rejects knowledge with no provenance (who said it, where,
   when). Knowledge without a source is just a rumor, and rumors don't get in.
2. **Nothing is believed until a human verifies it.** New knowledge lands as a
   `draft`, quarantined from injection. AI agents can *record* knowledge over
   MCP, but they cannot promote it — verification is deliberately a human act
   (`yoke verify`). Only `verified` knowledge ever reaches your AI's context.
3. **Nothing is silently overwritten.** Storage is append-only: an edit is a new
   version, a deletion is a tombstone. You can always reconstruct what the
   system believed at any point in time, and every injected item carries a
   citation — `[type:id@vN] actor, occurred_at` — so every claim is auditable.
4. **Contradictions are surfaced, never auto-resolved.** When new knowledge
   conflicts with what's already verified, yoke keeps both and links them with
   a `conflicts_with` edge for a human to settle. A disagreement is itself
   knowledge; deciding the winner is not the database's job.
5. **Knowledge expires.** Verified isn't forever — entries lose freshness past
   their type's TTL and are demoted to `stale` at read time, out of the
   injection path until someone re-confirms them. Stale truths are the
   politest form of misinformation, and yoke treats them that way.

And it's measured, not asserted: the injection-quality eval reports **0%
contamination** and **0% missed contradictions** (see below).

Runs local and embedded — better-sqlite3 + FTS5 + sqlite-vec, no server required.

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **One-line summary** | A database optimized for knowledge: structure it as an ontology, then inject only the verified subset relevant to the current context into your AI — with citations. |
| **Front adapters** | An **MCP server** (`inject` · `commit` · `record_decision` · `persona` · `use_scope`) and a **thin CLI**. Every AI tool is just an MCP client — no per-tool adapter. |
| **Storage backends** | `sqlite` (default, FTS5 + sqlite-vec) · `kuzu` (embedded graph) · `qdrant` (vector search) · `sharded` (multi-backend federation by tenant). All pass one conformance suite. |
| **Capture connectors** | `github-pr` (review comments), `slack` (channels + threads), `notes` (local transcripts), `rdb` (Postgres/MySQL read-mapping) — external sources → draft knowledge. |
| **Persona** | "How would a teammate decide?" → their recorded, verified judgments, cited and generated live. Citation, not impersonation. |
| **Shared working context** | Pin a `workstream` and a team shares one context; scope prioritizes without hiding org-wide knowledge. |
| **Enterprise** | Namespaced multi-tenancy · OIDC/SSO + API tokens · RBAC (the `verify` permission is the governance permission) · read replicas · online backup + point-in-time export. |

## 60-second quickstart

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhso-dev/yoke/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
# clones to ~/.yoke/app, builds, and links the global `yoke` command
# (--skip-link to skip the link, --dir PATH to change the location)

yoke init                                    # create ./yoke.db + seed the ontology
yoke add fact --attr statement="Deployments only happen Tuesday mornings"
yoke review                                  # inspect the draft queue
yoke verify <id>                             # promote it (or: yoke verify --all-drafts)
yoke inject "when do we deploy"              # inject only verified knowledge, with citations
```

Anything added via `add` starts as a `draft`. It won't show up in `inject` until
you promote it with `verify` — that gate is the whole point of the governance
model. Use `yoke verify --all-drafts` to promote in bulk on a cold start.

Prefer to build from source (contributors)? Clone and link directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhso-dev/yoke && cd yoke
npm install && npm run build && npm link   # provides the global `yoke` command
```

Recording a decision:

```bash
yoke add decision \
  --attr conclusion="Cache with Redis" \
  --attr rationale="P99 latency exceeded our target" \
  --attr rejected_alternatives="in-process cache"
```

## MCP setup

Attach yoke to an agent (Claude Code and friends) as a stdio MCP server. In your
project root `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yoke": {
      "command": "yoke",
      "args": ["mcp", "--db", "./yoke.db"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools exposed:

- `yoke_inject` — query a context → inject verified knowledge, with citations
- `yoke_commit` — stage knowledge (enters as `draft`)
- `yoke_record_decision` — decision shortcut (conclusion + rationale + rejected alternatives)
- `yoke_persona` — person-scoped injection ("how would a teammate decide?")
- `yoke_use_scope` — pin the current workstream so the whole session shares one working context

Configure the embedding provider (which enables duplicate/contradiction detection)
through environment variables. If unset, yoke falls back to FTS:

```bash
export YOKE_EMBED_URL=https://api.example.com/v1   # OpenAI-compatible /embeddings
export YOKE_EMBED_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
export YOKE_EMBED_KEY=sk-...
```

Free, local, and keyless via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (verified live —
duplicate warnings and `conflicts_with` detection both fire):

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
export YOKE_EMBED_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export YOKE_EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text            # no key needed
```

## CLI

```
yoke init | add | get | search | review | verify | deprecate
yoke inject <query> [--include-draft] [--scope <id>]
yoke conflicts | ontology <list|add-type> | persona <person-id>
yoke history <id> | audit [--since ts]
yoke connect github-pr|slack|notes|rdb ...
yoke mcp | ui | serve [--auth] | token <create|list|revoke>
yoke backup | restore | export [--until ts]   # --shards <file> federates backends
```

Common options: `--db` (> `YOKE_DB` env > `./yoke.db`), `--actor`
(> `YOKE_ACTOR` env > `yoke:system`), and `--json` (machine-readable output).

## Shared working context

A team builds one knowledge space together, in real time. When the user says
"this is PAY-42 work", the agent declares it once with `yoke_use_scope`, and the
whole session defaults to that `workstream` — injections lead with its knowledge,
and anything recorded links to it automatically. A decision one person records
(and a human verifies) is in every other session's context the next time they ask.

Scope **prioritizes, it doesn't imprison**: a pinned workstream leads, but
org-wide facts and personas still flow in on a query. And the context outlives
the work — when the workstream wraps, its knowledge stays in the graph as org
memory rather than vanishing into a closed ticket.

## Measuring quality

Instead of a recall benchmark, yoke measures **injection quality** (`npm run eval`):

| Metric | Definition | Target | Measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contamination rate | Share of draft entries among inject results | 0% | **0.0%** (only the 20 verified of 40 candidates were injected) |
| Missed-contradiction rate | Share of opposing-conclusion decision pairs with no conflicts_with edge | 0% | **0.0%** (5/5 detected) |
